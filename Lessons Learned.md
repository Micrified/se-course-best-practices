This document contains a collection of lessons learned from students whom have
followed the SE course and developed a solution for their customer.

We created this document hoping you will learn from the mistakes
and achievements of your colleagues.
Most probably, nothing is 100% proven to be true (just as this statement), and only likelihoods exists.
Thus, we only include lessons we think _most probably_ will apply to you.
Please remain critical and try to see how they work for your situation.

This document is open-source, and thus your experiences could help prove
some tips to be misleading, or you could even help us introduce new ones ;)
